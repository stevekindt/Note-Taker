# Note-Taker

The application uses an express backend to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. HTML routes will return specified HTML files. A JSON file is used to store and retrieve notes using the fs module. API routes use GET, POST, and DELETE methods to interact with the JSON file and update the notes in the application.
